## About:
# This script replaces instances of #PUBLIC_IP in the HaProxy configuration files
# with the real public ip. There's an order of priority here which is
# 1. Environment variable
# 2. AWS EC2 Metadata endpoint
# 3. Third-party sources
# If all fails, we'll just not set the destination IP address

CONFIG_FILE="/usr/local/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg"

## Custom function to use as curl wrapper
# --silent: to reduce the nois eof response
# --show-error: to show errors in the response
# --fail: to fail on non-200 responses
# --ipv4: to force ipv4 resolution
# --max-time: to set a timeout
function fetch() {
  curl --silent --show-error --fail --ipv4 --max-time 2 "$@"
}
